We have these questions to answer:
- Scan the machine, how many ports are open?
- What service is running on port 22?
- What service is running on port 80?
- What is the user.txt flag?
- What is the root.txt flag?

On port 22 is ssh by default, and on port 80 is http, but first let's check it with a nmap scan - btw, we will then be able to answer question number 1

```bash
nmap -oN nmap.txt -Pn -T4 -sC -sV -p- 10.10.127.219
```

I immediately received a warning `Warning: 10.10.127.219 giving up on port because retransmission cap hit (6).`

So unfortunately too many requests to the server, I reduced  `-T4` to `-T3` and I deleted `-p-` and let it go again

and in the background I ran gobuster

```bash
gobuster dir -o gobuster.txt -u 10.10.127.219 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

It showed me quite interesting directories, such as `/admin` and `/etc`

```

```

nmap was over at the time and this came out of its output:
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
```

So in answer to question 1, I entered that they're 2 ports open. Btw, it was also able to confirm what is on these ports

I went to `/etc` and found 2 files there:

![](1.png)

of which `passwd` contains quite interesting things to me

![](2.png)

I cracked this hash using John the ripper

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt passwd
```

success

![](3.png)

I went into the directory `/admin` after that, and I found "Admins" in the navbar

![](4.png)

I found out that you need to find a backup named "music_archive", so I clicked right on "Archive" and then it showed me the **Download**  button which allowed me to download the `archive.tar` file.

![](5.png)

So a quick unzip of this file flew in

```bash
tar -xf archive.tar
```

Going to `home/field/dev/final_archive` I noticed various other files, so I did `cat` to read `README` file.

![](6.png)
![](7.png)

Hm, let's check it out

![](8.png)

It looks like some sort of backup program

I went into usage, and a bit later I googled `borg`'s github

I also downloaded it https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/releases

I listed this previously downloaded archive using borg

```
./borg list home/field/dev/final_archive
```

it asked me for a password, so I typed in the previously cracked `squidward`

![](9.png)

Well, let's try to extract it

```bash
./borg extract home/field/dev/final_archive/::music_archive
```

Asked me again for the password, so I typed `squidward`.

home folder appeared, which contained the user data of user `alex`

![](10.png)

![](11.png)

I decided to check it out, but this time nothing interesting

![](12.png)

I'm trying to keep going

![](13.png)

![](14.png)

well we have something, I will try to log into ssh with this

![](15.png)

Success! additionally by executing `ls` I was able to trace the user flag

![](16.png)

Doing `sudo -l` also managed to discover something that can help escalate privileges

![](17.png)

I'll display for myself what's in that file

![](18.png)

I'll also check the permissions right away

![](19.png)

Well, unfortunately, this time it will not be possible to escalate this user simply by editing this script

But, it is worth noting that this script includes the `getopts` function which is a built-in function for parsing script arguments and options. Tbh, I hadn't heard of this function before, but it caught my attention.

![](20.png)

I used this function, using `sudo /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh -c /bin/bash`

![](21.png)

Well, and I got shell root. But unfortunately I wasn't getting the output of the commands I typed in

![](22.png)

In that case, I tried privilege escalation via the SUID bit

so as root:
- I entered `/tmp`
- and I did `cp /bin/bash ./bash`
- I also added SUID bit `chmod +s bash`
- I typed `exit` and returned to the user shell

![](23.png)

as a user I did:
- `cd /tmp`
- `ls -la`

![](24.png)

I went to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/bash/#suid) and I read information on escalating root privileges using the SUID bit

and I typed as `alex` the `./bash -p` command

![](25.png)

We have root shell again. Let's see if we can see the output of the commands this time

![](26.png)

Great, all that's left is `cat /root/root.txt`
