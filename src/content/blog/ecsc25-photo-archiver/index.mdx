## Photo Archiver
*(39 solves)*

The description of the challange:
> Don't you hate when a very cool page goes down and all of your bookmarked memes go down? That's why I created a service to archive random URLs on the Internet.

Also, the [source code](https://photo-archiver.ecsc25.hack.cert.pl/source) is provided when you visit the website given in the challenge.

## Vulnerability Analysis

### SSRF protection bypass

The SSRF filter tries to block requests to localhost by resolving the hostname and checking if it is `127.0.0.1`:

```python
resolved = resolve_domain(parsed.hostname)

if not resolved:
    abort(400, "bad host")

logging.info("resolved: %s", resolved)

if resolved == "127.0.0.1":
    abort(400, "bad ip")
```

However, the check is too narrow:
- It only blocks `127.0.0.1`, but not other loopback addresses like `127.0.0.2`, `127.0.0.3`, etc.
- The DNS rebinded domain can resolve to `127.0.0.2`, which is still a loopback address, but not exactly `127.0.0.1`.
- This means you can use any other loopback address (except `127.0.0.1`, which is sanitized) to reach localhost services, and the filter won't catch it.

### Flag function

The flag is protected by the following route:

```python
@app.route("/flag")
def get_flag():
    remote_ip = request.environ.get('HTTP_X_REAL_IP')

    if remote_ip and remote_ip != "127.0.0.1":
        abort(401)

    return make_response(FLAG)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=23612)
```

The `/flag` endpoint is designed to only return the flag if the request appears to come from localhost. It checks the `HTTP_X_REAL_IP` header, and if it's missing or set to `127.0.0.1`, the flag is returned. Otherwise, access is denied.

However, when the server itself makes a request (as in SSRF), this header is often not set at all, or the request is seen as coming from localhost, which allows the flag to be returned.

## Exploit

To exploit this, submit the following URL to the archive form:

```
http://<dns-rebound-domain>:23612/flag#.png
```

The server downloads the flag and saves it as an image (`<img src="/image/flag">`) in your session storage.

You can then visit `/image/flag` to retrieve the flag (it will be downloaded as a file; you need to open it in a text editor).

```
ecsc25{TOCTOU-is-a-weird-acronym}
```

### Why does it work?

- Incomplete SSRF filter only blocks `127.0.0.1`, not all loopback addresses (`127.0.0.0/8`).
- DNS rebinding allows you to use attacker-controlled DNS to resolve to internal or loopback addresses, bypassing SSRF filters that only check for `127.0.0.1`
- The `/flag` endpoint checks `HTTP_X_REAL_IP`. Since the request is made locally, this header is likely missing or set to `None`, so it allows the request.
- The fragment `#` is ignored by the HTTP protocol, so the server fetches `/flag`, not `/flag#.png`.
- The `.png` at the end passes the file extension check.
