## Caller
*(51 solves)*

The description of the challange:
> Naming things is hard. 

Additionally a [netcat](https://ctf101.org/faq/connecting-to-services/) service is provided, that runs the following:

```python
import os
import uuid


def main():
    FLAG = open("flag.txt", 'r').read().encode()
    arg = input("> ")
    blacklist = ['{', '}', ';', '\n']
    if len(arg) > 10 or any([c in arg for c in blacklist]):
        print("Bad input!")
        return
    template = f"""
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char* f(){{
    char* flag = "{FLAG}";
    printf("%s",flag);
    return flag;
}}

void g(char* {arg}){{}}

int main(){{
    g(NULL);
    return 0;
}}
"""
    name = "test"
    source = f"/tmp/{name}.c"
    outfile = f"/tmp/{name}"
    open(source, 'w').write(template)
    os.system(f"export PATH=$PATH:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin && gcc {source} -o {outfile}")
    os.system(f"{outfile}")
    os.remove(source)
    os.remove(outfile)


main()
```

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Input injection

The vulnerability lies in how the user input is inserted directly into a C function declaration as the name of a parameter:

```c
void g(char* {arg}){{}}
```

Although there is a blacklist in place to filter characters like `{`, `}`, `;`, and `\n`, the application does not validate whether the input is a valid C identifier. This leads to the possibility of injecting arbitrary expressions in place of the parameter name, as long as the input stays within 10 characters and avoids the blacklisted characters.

### Flag function

The flag is stored in the `f()` function:

```c
char* f(){
    char* flag = "{FLAG}";
    printf("%s",flag);
    return flag;
}
```

We need to find a way to **call this function** during runtime.
## Exploit

Since the user input is inserted directly as a parameter name (without quotes or escaping), we can exploit C's allowance of **function calls or expressions inside brackets** for array indexing or pointer operations.

For example, this input:
```
f[!f()]
```

Gets injected like this:
```c
void g(char* f[!f()]) { }
```

This results in:

1. A call to `f()` during array indexing expression evaluation - which prints the flag (`printf("%s",flag);`).
2. The result of `!f()` is used as an array index. But we don't care about its value - we just need the side effect of calling `f()`.

```shell
> f[!f()]
b'ecsc25{thats_some_weird_variable_name}'
```
### Why does it work?

- The code compiles because C allows expressions like `type name[expression]` in parameter declarations.
- `f[!f()]` looks like an array of pointers named `f` with size `!f()` - but `f()` is called as part of evaluating that.
- The expression `!f()` coerces the return value of `f()` (a non-null pointer) into a boolean, then negates it. Crucially, evaluating `!f()` calls `f()`as part of that process.
- Because `f()` contains `printf("%s", flag);`, each evaluation of `!f()` triggers the flag to be printed, even though the boolean result (0 or 1) is irrelevant to the program’s logic.
- Blacklist bypass: Since `f[!f()]` contains no braces `{}`, semicolons `;`, or newlines, and is under 10 characters, it bypasses the simple input filter while fully leveraging C’s type and expression rules.
